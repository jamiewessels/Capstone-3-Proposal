# Capstone-3-Proposal



## A-CHORD-ing 2 the Image: 
#### Goal: Image classifier that can identify the chord. Images will be of a hand playing a chord on a piano.

I am going to start with just 3 chords: C, F, G and no inversions (meaning base note is always the key - fingers always on the 1-3-5).  A lot of songs can be played with just these 3 chords - that is why I chose them

#### Background: 
While there are many chord identifiers based on audio input, I have not identified chord identifiers based on image.  I think this could have an impact during this time of virtual learning and could also aid deaf people in learning to play the piano.  This would be a precursor to transcribing a song based on a video of someone playing.

#### Concerns: 
Most of the images would be of my hand or my husband’s hand.  We are asking friends who have access to a piano to also send images to add to the collection. It’s quick to take the different images, so I am shooting for 300 images per class.  I would then use an augmenter to make more images and add variability.  I am concerned about bias if most of the hands are mine or my husbands (we are both white).

#### Example of an Image: 



## Ro-bob Dylan (Text - Generator)
#### Goal: 
The goal of this project would be to use NLP+RNN to use the complete collection of Bob Dylan’s lyrics in order to create a text completion bot that would create poetry lines.

#### About the Dataset: 
500 songs, approximately 160 words per song (non-unique).  

#### Concerns: 
I’m hard-core studying Keras/Tensorflow over the next weekend, but is this too complicated?   

I originally wanted to do a Michael Scott Bot (I LOVE the office and found the script online) but saw that someone already did this. 


## Identifying Melanoma from images
Note: I’m not as excited about this project as the chord classifier, although I think the dataset is more robust.


#### Goal: 
Use image classification to identify melanoma skin lesions as benign or malignant 
(using the ISIC melanoma project dataset).  

#### Background: 
This is important to me because my father passes away from metastatic melanoma and it is one of the most lethal and common cancers.  Early identification of malignant skin lesions is very important.

#### Dataset: 
Large dataset available (20,000 benign, 2,000 malignant)
